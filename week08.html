    <h1>Week 08 notes</h1>
    <p> 
        I really didn't know what to do on this week readins, I have to say that the "Develop, Debug, Learn?" video scared me a little bit. I think it was really nice that he was making
         this talk about beign more creative with your code. I want to be able to create things as he says but it's true that seems like you need to learn a lot of things very quickly and I don't 
         know if I will be able to learn everything or pretend that I know, I work on my own, what I am going to do when I get stuck on my work place? Will they expect me to know hw to fix everything? 
         I try to have a support net with developer friends that I know, but it is really hard and I hope I will be able to hold my ow when the time come for me to test my knowledge and capacities.
